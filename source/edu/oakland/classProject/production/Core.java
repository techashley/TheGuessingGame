* This class holds all of the core functionality of TheGuessingGame backend.

* keeping track of the number of guesses made so far, determining and keeping
* track of the range of possible numbers which contain the number the user 
* picked, the upper bound (the highest number the user is allowed to pick), 
* and performing a binomial in order to efficiently guess the number the user
* picked.
